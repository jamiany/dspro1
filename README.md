## Short Description

Our project aims to develop a Spotify song clustering system. The goal is to take a playlist of randomly selected songs and intelligently group them based on their similarities. This would allow users to easily organize and discover patterns in their playlists. The idea is to select a representative song for each cluster, using it as a basis to separate or categorize the rest of the songs within the playlist.
